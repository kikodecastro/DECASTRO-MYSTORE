    <p>"Barney didn't just fade away—he *rotted* into this." </p>
    <p>Introducing the Violet Mango: the cursed offspring of everyone's favorite purple dinosaur. You thought you knew Barney? You thought he was forever cheerful and loving? Well, meet the fruit version of what happens when that optimism dies a slow, painful death. The Violet Mango didn’t just age—it *festered*, becoming a disgusting, bruised, mutated version of what it once was. It’s the mango equivalent of Barney’s broken, disillusioned soul after years of living in a kids’ TV show bubble. </p>
    <p>It’s what happens when childhood joy is crushed under the weight of existential dread. The Violet Mango is not sweet, it’s not cute—it’s *rotting* from the inside out. If you dare to bite it, you're not just tasting a fruit, you’re tasting the bitterness of failed dreams and purple mascots lost to time. Barney’s legacy didn’t die, it just decayed into this sad, wrinkled horror.</p>
    <p>Perfect for those who miss the days when Barney was on TV, but deep down know: he was never real. Just like this mango. Enjoy the taste of forgotten childhood and rotting nostalgia.</p>
