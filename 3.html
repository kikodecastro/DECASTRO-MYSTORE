    <p>"Two mangoes, one fate... and no escape." </p>
    <p>This isn’t just a mango—this is a *cursed fruit*. Two mangoes, conjoined at the core, condemned to share their existence forever. Neither wanted this. One dreamed of sweet solitude. The other... just wanted to be eaten. Together, they rot. Together, they suffer. And yet, they are bound. A grotesque reminder that life is nothing but a series of tragic entanglements from which there is no release.</p>
    <p>Perfect for those who find beauty in decay, or for anyone who wants to bite into the bleak reality of existence. It’s not just a fruit—it’s a metaphor for life. The mango that refuses to die, and the soul that can’t break free. Enjoy your fate.</p>
