    <p>"The mango was once great... now it's a fruit's version of a bad breakup."</p>
    <p>What happens when you leave a mango too long? Well, it might start off as your sweet, juicy snack, but give it time, and it transforms into a mushy, stinky disaster that’ll have you questioning your life choices. It's the mango that didn’t make it to the party, and now it’s the one that nobody talks about. </p>
    <p>Perfect for when you want a surprise (but not the good kind). A rotten mango: because sometimes, life just doesn’t go according to plan.</p>
